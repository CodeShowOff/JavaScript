Yes, `console` in `console.log()` is **part of JavaScript**, but more precisely:

* `console` is a **built-in global object** provided by the **JavaScript runtime environment**, such as browsers (like Chrome, Firefox) or Node.js.
* It's not part of the **core ECMAScript specification** (which defines the language), but it is a **commonly implemented API** in almost all JavaScript environments.

### Breakdown:

* `console` is the object.
* `.log()` is a method on the `console` object that outputs messages to the web console or terminal.

### Common methods on the `console` object:

* `console.log()` — logs standard output
* `console.error()` — logs error messages
* `console.warn()` — logs warnings
* `console.table()` — logs data in table format

### Summary:

✅ `console` is part of the **JavaScript environment**, not the language specification itself, but it's available in virtually every JavaScript context you’ll work in.
