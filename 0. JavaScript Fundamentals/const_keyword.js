// Good question! ** Even though `books` is declared as `const`, we can still modify its contents ** because ** `const` only prevents reassigning the variable itself, not modifying the array's contents**.

// ### 🚀 ** Why Can We Modify `books` Even Though It's `const`?**

const books = []; // Declared as const

books.push({ title: "New Book", genre: "Mystery", publish: 2023 }); // ✅ Works fine!
books.pop(); // ✅ Works fine!
books[0] = { title: "Updated Book", genre: "Sci-Fi", publish: 2024 }; // ✅ Works fine!

books = []; // ❌ ERROR! Cannot reassign a 'const' variable

/*
### 🔥 ** Key Takeaways **
✅ ** We can add, remove, or modify elements ** in the`books` array.  
❌ ** We cannot reassign ** `books` to a new array(`books = [...]` will throw an error).

---

### ✅ ** How Our Code Works Fine **
    In our `UserLibrary` class:
```js
addBook(book) {
    books.push(book); // ✅ This works because push() modifies the array, not reassigns it
    console.log(`✅ ${ this.userName } added a new book: `, book);
}
```
This ** modifies the existing `books` array ** instead of replacing it, so it's allowed.

---

### **💡 When Should You Use `let` Instead of`const` ?**
    If you ** plan to completely replace ** the array later, use`let` instead of `const`:
```js
let books = []; // Now we can reassign a new array later
books = [...books, { title: "New Book", genre: "Mystery", publish: 2023 }]; // ✅ Works fine
```
But if you ** only need to modify the contents **, `const` is perfectly fine!

---

🔥 ** So our `addBook()` method works fine with `const`! ** Let me know if you need more clarification! 😎
