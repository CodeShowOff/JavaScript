# **Callback Function**

A **callback** is a **function passed as an argument to another function**, and it is **executed later**, usually after some kind of operation is completed.

---

### 🔁 **Why Use a Callback?**

To **handle asynchronous operations** or **customize behavior** by allowing one function to call another when it's ready.

---

### ✅ **Basic Example (Synchronous Callback):**

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hi " + name);
  callback();
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Bye!");
}

greet("Alice", sayBye);
```

#### Output:

```
Hi Alice
Bye!
```

Here, `sayBye` is passed as a callback to `greet`.

---

### ⏳ **Asynchronous Callback Example:**

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

In this example:

- `setTimeout` is an async function.
- The callback (an anonymous function) runs **after 2 seconds**.

---

### 🔄 Callback Pattern in Practice:

Callbacks are foundational in:

- **Event handling** (e.g., `button.addEventListener`)
- **APIs** (e.g., `fetch`, older AJAX)
- **Custom flow control**

---

### ⚠️ Callback Hell:

When callbacks are nested too deeply, code becomes messy:

```javascript
doSomething(function (result) {
  doSomethingElse(result, function (moreResult) {
    doAnotherThing(moreResult, function (finalResult) {
      console.log(finalResult);
    });
  });
});
```

✅ Modern JavaScript often uses **Promises** and **async/await** to avoid this.

# 🧠 **What Is a Callback — In Simple Steps**

Let’s look at this code:

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### ✅ Step 1: Define the Function

You write this function:

```javascript
function() {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}
```

This is just a **regular function** — but you're not calling it yourself right now.

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Pass That Function to `setTimeout`

You're saying:

> "Hey JavaScript, here's a function. Don't run it now — **run it after 2 seconds**."

This function becomes a **callback** because it's passed as an **argument** to another function (`setTimeout`) and will be **called later**.

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Timer Starts

`setTimeout` sets a timer (in this case, 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds). While this timer runs, the rest of your code can keep executing.

---

#### ✅ Step 4: After 2 Seconds, the Function Is “Called Back”

Once the 2 seconds are over, **JavaScript "calls back" the function you passed earlier**. That’s when this happens:

```javascript
console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
```

---

### 🔁 So Why Is It Called a “Callback”?

Because:

- You **pass a function** to another function.
- That other function **calls your function back** at the right time (after an event, a timer, or a task finishes).

---

# **If we can just call the function directly inside, why would we pass it as an argument?**

Let's answer that with **why we pass functions as arguments (callbacks)** — instead of just calling them directly.

---

## ✅ The Core Idea

### 📌 Because we want **`flexibility`** and **`custom behavior`**.

By **passing a function as an argument**, we let another function **decide when and how to call it**, rather than hardcoding it.

---

## 🧠 Think About This:

### 🔴 Calling function directly (hardcoded):

```javascript
function wait() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}
```

- This function **always** logs `"Done!"` after 1 second.
- You **can't change** what happens after 1 second unless you rewrite the function.

---

### ✅ Passing function as argument (callback):

```javascript
function wait(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}
```

Now you can do **whatever you want** after 1 second:

```javascript
wait((msg) => console.log(msg)); // Logs: Done!
wait((msg) => alert(msg)); // Alerts: Done!
wait((msg) => (document.body.innerText = msg)); // Changes page text
```

---

### ✅ Real-World Example: Buttons

Imagine this:

```javascript
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("You clicked!");
});
```

Why pass a function?
Because **you don't know when** the user will click — JavaScript will **call back** your function **when the event happens**.

If you ran the function immediately, it wouldn't wait for the click.

---

## ✅ Summary: Why Pass Functions as Arguments?

| Reason                      | Explanation                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Delay or defer execution | Let something else decide **when to run** the function                 |
| 🔧 Reuse behavior           | The parent function doesn't need to know what exactly will happen      |
| 📦 Encapsulate logic        | Keeps your code modular and flexible                                   |
| 🧩 Works with async/events  | Essential for handling **events**, **timers**, **API responses**, etc. |

---

# Let's understand it with a proper comparision:

Awesome question again! You're absolutely right to compare those two approaches — and yes, **they’re similar in behavior**, but **they’re different in flexibility and design**.

Let’s go step by step and compare:

---

## ✅ Version 1: Using a **Callback** (function passed as an argument)

```javascript
function wait(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}

wait((msg) => console.log(msg));
```

### ✅ What's happening?

- You pass **any function you want** into `wait()`.
- Inside `wait()`, it doesn’t care what that function does — it just calls it.
- Very **flexible**: you can reuse `wait()` with different behaviors.

---

## 🔁 Version 2: Calling a **hardcoded** function from inside

```javascript
function wait() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    message("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}

function message(msg) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

### ✅ What's happening?

- `wait()` always uses the `message()` function.
- The behavior after 1 second is **fixed** — always calls `message()`.

---

## ⚖️ So What’s the Difference?

| Feature                     | Callback Version                           | Hardcoded Version                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔧 **Flexibility**          | ✅ You can pass any function               | ❌ Always calls the same function          |
| 🔁 **Reusability**          | ✅ More reusable for different use cases   | ❌ Limited to one specific use case        |
| 🔍 **Control from outside** | ✅ Caller decides what happens             | ❌ Logic is fixed inside the function      |
| 💬 **Real-world example**   | Like saying: “Call me back with your news” | Like saying: “Only ever call my assistant” |

---

### ✅ Why callbacks are better in many cases:

Imagine you're building a **library function** for others to use:

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Fetch data...
  callback(data); // You don't know what user wants to do with it
}
```

Now someone using it can do:

```javascript
fetchData((data) => showOnScreen(data));
fetchData((data) => saveToFile(data));
fetchData((data) => alert(data));
```

You didn’t need to write 3 separate functions. **Your function is now powerful and reusable.**

---

## 🧠 Summary:

Yes — your version **works** and is perfectly fine for **simple, fixed behavior**.

But using **callbacks**:

- Gives you more **flexibility**
- Makes functions more **reusable and customizable**
- Is essential for **asynchronous workflows**, **event handling**, and **library design**
