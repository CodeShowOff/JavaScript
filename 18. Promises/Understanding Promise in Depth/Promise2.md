Got it â€” you're asking **how the syntax works**, not what a Promise does.

You're absolutely right to focus on the **underlying function mechanics**. Let's dissect this line very carefully:

```js
const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ... });
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Let's break it down step by step:

### ðŸ§© 1. `new Promise(...)`

* `Promise` is a **constructor function** â€” it's a class-like object in JavaScript.
* When you use `new`, you're **creating an instance** of that class.
* The `Promise` constructor **expects a function** as its only argument.

### ðŸ§© 2. `function(resolve, reject) { ... }`

* This is an **anonymous function** being passed directly as an argument to the `Promise` constructor.
* Itâ€™s known as the **executor function**.
* This function is immediately **invoked internally** by the `Promise` class as soon as the promise is created.
* The `Promise` constructor **calls this function** and **passes in two parameters**:

  * `resolve` â€“ a function you can call to **fulfill** the promise.
  * `reject` â€“ a function you can call to **reject** the promise.

So this:

```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ... });
```

Is equivalent in concept to:

```js
function myExecutor(resolve, reject) {
    // do something
}

new Promise(myExecutor);
```

Itâ€™s just that you're using an **anonymous function inline** instead of declaring it separately.

---

## ðŸ”¹ So... who provides `resolve` and `reject`?

The **`Promise` class internally creates** these two functions and passes them to your executor function.

Think of it like this pseudo-code (not real JS, just for concept):

```js
function Promise(executorFn) {
    const resolve = (value) => { /* mark fulfilled */ };
    const reject = (error) => { /* mark rejected */ };
    
    executorFn(resolve, reject); // <-- THIS is the key
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s happening under the hood?

Youâ€™re essentially doing this:

```js
const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // your code here
});
```

JavaScript's engine does:

1. Call the `Promise` constructor.
2. Inside the constructor, it creates the internal `resolve()` and `reject()` functions.
3. Then it **immediately calls your anonymous function**, passing `resolve` and `reject` as arguments.
4. Your function executes and at some point calls either `resolve()` or `reject()`.

## ðŸ”¹ TL;DR

| Syntax Element              | What It Is                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new Promise(...)`          | Creates a new Promise object                                      |
| `function(resolve, reject)` | An **executor function** passed to the constructor                |
| `resolve` / `reject`        | Functions provided by the `Promise` class and passed as arguments |
| Anonymous function          | Just a function without a name, defined inline                    |

Let me know if you want to see this broken down with arrow functions or how this pattern works with `async/await` behind the scenes.
