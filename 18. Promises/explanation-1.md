Absolutely! Let's break down the code step-by-step so you understand how it works, especially focusing on the syntax and how Promises behave in JavaScript.

---

### 🔹 Code:

```javascript
const promiseThree = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        resolve({ username: "shubham", email: "shu@mail.com" });
    }, 1000);
});

promiseThree.then(function (userData) {
    console.log(userData);
});
```

---

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. `new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { ... })`

* This creates a **new Promise object**.
* A Promise represents a value that may be **available now**, **in the future**, or **never**.
* The function you pass to `new Promise(...)` is called the **executor function**.
* It receives two functions as arguments:

  * `resolve`: call this when the promise **succeeds**.
  * `reject`: call this when the promise **fails**.

---

#### 2. Inside the Promise:

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
    resolve({ username: "shubham", email: "shu@mail.com" });
}, 1000);
```

* `setTimeout` simulates an **asynchronous operation** (like fetching data).
* After 1 second (1000 ms), it calls `resolve(...)`.
* `resolve(...)` completes the Promise **successfully** and sends back a value (in this case, an object with `username` and `email`).

---

#### 3. `.then(...)` block:

```javascript
promiseThree.then(function (userData) {
    console.log(userData);
});
```

* `.then(...)` is used to **handle the result** of the Promise **after it resolves**.
* Whatever you passed to `resolve(...)` becomes available as `userData` in this `.then(...)` callback.
* So it logs:

```
{ username: 'shubham', email: 'shu@mail.com' }
```

after 1 second.

---

### 🔹 Summary

This code:

* Creates a promise that resolves after 1 second.
* After resolving, it provides an object `{ username: ..., email: ... }`.
* Then it logs that object to the console.

---

### ✅ Output (after 1 second):

```js
{ username: 'shubham', email: 'shu@mail.com' }
```

# Now lets see, how does `.then()` get the value from `resolve(...)`?

Let’s go **deep into how Promises work under the hood** to answer:

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step: How `.then()` Gets `userData`

Here’s the key part of the code again:

```js
const promiseThree = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        resolve({ username: "shubham", email: "shu@mail.com" });
    }, 1000);
});

promiseThree.then(function (userData) {
    console.log(userData);
});
```

---

## 🧠 1. What Happens When You Call `resolve(...)`

When you call:

```js
resolve({ username: "shubham", email: "shu@mail.com" });
```

Internally, the JavaScript engine does something like:

```js
// Inside the Promise system (simplified)
promiseThree.internalState = "fulfilled";
promiseThree.internalValue = { username: "...", email: "..." };
```

So the promise is now **fulfilled**, and it has a **stored value** (the object).

---

## 📌 2. What Happens When You Call `.then(callback)`

When you wrote:

```js
promiseThree.then(function (userData) {
    console.log(userData);
});
```

This does **not** call the function immediately. Instead:

* It **registers** the callback (your function) with the Promise system.
* The Promise system says:

  > “When I become fulfilled, I will call this function with my internal value.”

This registration is internal. Think of it like:

```js
promiseThree.onFulfilled = function (userData) {
    console.log(userData);
};
```

---

## ⛓ 3. The Connection Between `resolve(...)` and `.then(...)`

Now here's the magic:

* When you call `resolve(data)`:

  1. The promise is marked as `fulfilled`.
  2. `internalValue` is set to `data`.
  3. All functions registered via `.then(...)` are put into a **microtask queue**, each with `internalValue` as the input.

So it’s like this (pseudocode):

```js
// after resolve(...) is called
queueMicrotask(() => {
  onFulfilled(internalValue); // i.e., your .then() function
});
```

That means:

```js
userData = internalValue; // <- here’s how userData gets the data
```

In your example:

```js
userData = { username: "shubham", email: "shu@mail.com" }
```

---

## ✅ Summary

So to directly answer:

> **How does `.then()` get `userData`?**

🔹 Because when `resolve(data)` is called, the Promise:

* **Stores** `data` as its internal value.
* **Schedules** all `.then()` callbacks to run **with that data** once the promise resolves.

> You can think of `.then(fn)` as saying:
>
> “When this promise resolves, call `fn(value)` with the resolved `value`.”

And `value` is exactly what you passed to `resolve(...)`.
