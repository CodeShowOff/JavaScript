Great question! You're referring to **prototypes** in JavaScript, which are a fundamental part of how JavaScript handles **inheritance** and **object creation**.

Let‚Äôs break it down in a simple way.

---

### üîÅ What is a Prototype?

In JavaScript, **every object** has a hidden property called `[[Prototype]]` (accessible via `__proto__` in most environments or through `Object.getPrototypeOf()`), which points to **another object**. This forms a **prototype chain**.

This prototype chain is how JavaScript handles **inheritance**.

---

### üß± Example:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
};

const alice = new Person('Alice');
alice.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Alice
```

Here's what happens under the hood:

* `alice` is an object.
* `alice.__proto__` points to `Person.prototype`.
* `Person.prototype.sayHello` is a function available to `alice` because of the prototype chain.

---

### üîó Why Does It Keep Going?

That chain doesn‚Äôt stop at one level. It continues until it reaches `null`.

So for `alice`:

```
alice
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __proto__ (Person.prototype)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __proto__ (Object.prototype)
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __proto__ (null)
```

Each level might have its own properties and methods. When you access `alice.sayHello()`, JavaScript:

1. Checks if `sayHello` exists on `alice`.
2. If not, goes to `alice.__proto__`.
3. If not there, goes to `Person.prototype.__proto__` (which is `Object.prototype`).
4. Keeps going until `null`.

---

### üß† Summary

* `prototype` is a property on **constructor functions** (like `Person.prototype`).
* `__proto__` is an internal property on **objects**, pointing to their prototype.
* JavaScript uses the **prototype chain** to resolve properties/methods.
* The chain ends at `Object.prototype`, which is the root.

---

If you‚Äôve seen things like:

```js
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__); // null
```

That‚Äôs the end of the chain.

Want a visual or code-based example of how to inspect and modify the prototype chain?
