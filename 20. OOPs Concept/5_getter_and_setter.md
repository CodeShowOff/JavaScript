You're seeing a **JavaScript class** called `User`, which tries to define a getter and setter for a property named `password`. But there's a **fatal logic flaw** that causes it to behave *unexpectedly* ‚Äî likely even crash or go into an infinite loop. Let's break it down:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem: Infinite Recursion

Inside the class:

```js
get password() {
    return this.password.toUpperCase();
}
```

This is a **getter** for `password`. But look at what it's doing:

* It tries to access `this.password` ‚Äî which **calls the getter again**.
* That again tries to access `this.password` ‚Üí calls the getter again ‚Üí repeat forever.

**Boom! üí• Infinite recursion** ‚Äî this causes a **maximum call stack size exceeded** error.

---

### Same Issue in the Setter

```js
set password(value) {
    this.password = value;
}
```

This tries to set `this.password`, which again invokes the **setter**, causing infinite recursion as well.

---

### ‚úÖ The Fix

To avoid this, you need to store the actual value in a **separate internal variable**, usually with a leading underscore:

```js
class User {
    constructor(email, password) {
        this.email = email;
        this._password = password;
    }

    get password() {
        return this._password.toUpperCase();
    }

    set password(value) {
        this._password = value;
    }
}

const userA = new User("shubham@mail.com", "123");
console.log(userA.password);  // Outputs: "123"
```

### üß† Summary

* Your original code causes **infinite recursion** because `this.password` calls the getter/setter again.
* Fix it by storing the actual value in a **different internal property**, like `_password`.

Let me know if you want to explore how to handle private fields more securely (using `#password`, for example).

# In JavaScript, **when a getter is defined for a property**, any access to that property will invoke the getter **instead of** directly accessing the stored value.

---

### üîÅ What happens with `this.password`

If you have:

```js
get password() {
    return this.password.toUpperCase();
}
```

Then every time you do:

```js
console.log(this.password);
```

‚Ä¶it **calls the getter**, which again tries to access `this.password`, which again calls the getter, and so on ‚Üí infinite loop.

---

### üß† Think of it like this:

* `this.password` is no longer a "regular property."
* It's now a **computed property** that runs a function whenever accessed.
* So accessing `this.password` inside the getter ends up calling the same getter again.

---

### ‚úÖ Safe Pattern (Use a different internal name)

```js
class User {
    constructor(email, password) {
        this.email = email;
        this._password = password;  // internal storage
    }

    get password() {
        return this._password.toUpperCase();  // safe
    }

    set password(value) {
        this._password = value;  // safe
    }
}
```

Now, `this.password` calls the getter, and `this._password` holds the actual value safely.

---

### üö® Bonus: Want real privacy?

You can also use **private fields** introduced in modern JavaScript:

```js
class User {
    #password;

    constructor(email, password) {
        this.email = email;
        this.#password = password;
    }

    get password() {
        return this.#password.toUpperCase();
    }

    set password(value) {
        this.#password = value;
    }
}
```

In this version, `#password` is **truly private** ‚Äî not accessible outside the class at all.
