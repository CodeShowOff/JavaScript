This code demonstrates how the `bind` keyword is used in JavaScript, particularly in the context of **class methods and event listeners**. Here's a full breakdown:

---

### 🔧 **What's Happening in This Code**

```js
class React {
    constructor() {
        this.library = "React";
        this.server = "https://localhost:3000";

        document.querySelector('button')
            .addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));
    }

    handleClick() {
        console.log("Button Clicked");
        console.log(this.server);          
    }
}

const app = new React();
```

### 🧠 Core Concepts

#### 1. **`this` in JavaScript** behaves differently based on how a function is called:

* Inside a class, `this` refers to the instance.
* Inside an event handler, `this` refers to the element that triggered the event (`<button>` in this case).

---

### 🛑 The Problem Without `.bind(this)`

If you write:

```js
document.querySelector('button')
    .addEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
```

Then when the button is clicked:

* `this` inside `handleClick()` will **not** refer to the class instance (`React`).
* Instead, `this` will refer to the `<button>` element.
* So `this.server` will be **`undefined`**, and it may cause an error.

---

### ✅ The Solution: `.bind(this)`

```js
this.handleClick.bind(this)
```

* This **binds the class context** (`this` inside the constructor) to the `handleClick` method.
* So now, when `handleClick()` is triggered by the button, it still knows what `this` means — the `React` class instance.

---

### 🔍 How `.bind(this)` Works

* It returns a **new function** with `this` permanently set to the provided value.
* It **does not immediately call** the function — it just locks in the `this` value.

---

### ✅ Output When Button is Clicked

```
Button Clicked
https://localhost:3000
```

---

### 🧪 TL;DR:

* `bind(this)` is used to **preserve the correct `this` context** inside class methods used in event listeners or callbacks.
* Without it, `this` will point to the DOM element (`<button>`) and `this.server` will be `undefined`.

Let me know if you want examples using `call`, `apply`, or arrow functions (`()=>`) to solve this differently.
