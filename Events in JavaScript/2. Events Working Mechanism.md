## 📌 **What is an Event in JavaScript?**

An **event** in JavaScript is an action or occurrence recognized by the browser. This action could be triggered by the user (e.g., clicking a button, pressing a key), or by the browser itself (e.g., page load).

## 🔔 **How is an Event Invoked?**

Events are **invoked** when the user interacts with a webpage or when a browser-based activity occurs.

### 👉 Ways to Invoke Events:

1. **User actions**:

   * Clicking a button → invokes the `click` event
   * Typing in a field → invokes the `input` or `keydown` event

2. **Automatically by the browser**:

   * Page finishes loading → invokes the `load` event

3. **Programmatically (via JavaScript)**:
   You can simulate an event using `.click()` or `dispatchEvent()`:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("myBtn").click(); // Simulates a click
   ```

## ⚙️ **How Does an Event Work?**

When an event occurs:

1. The **event is fired**.
2. The **browser checks** if any handler (function) is attached to that event on the element.
3. If a handler exists, it is **executed**.

```javascript
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button was clicked");
});
```

* Here, when the button is clicked, the function runs — this is how the event *works*.

## ⏰ **When Does an Event Work?**

An event works when:

* The element exists in the DOM.
* The event listener is attached **before** the event happens.
* The browser supports that event type.

Events like `click`, `load`, `submit`, `keypress`, etc., only work:

* When the user interacts (for user events), **or**
* When the browser triggers them (for browser events like `load`)

---

## 🔄 **Event Propagation**

When an event happens, it propagates in **three phases**:

### 1. **Capturing Phase** (Trickling Down)

* Event starts from the root of the DOM tree (`window`) and goes down toward the target element.

### 2. **Target Phase**

* The event reaches the actual target element.

### 3. **Bubbling Phase** (Bubbling Up)

* The event bubbles back up to the root, triggering event handlers on parent elements.

### 🔁 Example: Capturing vs Bubbling

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Parent clicked");
}, false); // Bubbling phase

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Child clicked");
}, false); // Bubbling phase
```

**Clicking the button logs:**

```
Child clicked
Parent clicked
```

If you use `true` in `addEventListener`, it uses **capturing phase**:

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Parent clicked");
}, true); // Capturing phase
```

Then the output will be:

```
Parent clicked
Child clicked
```

| **What is an event?**    | A signal that something has happened (e.g., click, load, keypress). |
| **How is it invoked?**   | By user actions, browser triggers, or JavaScript code.              |
| **How does it work?**    | The browser detects the event and calls attached handler functions. |
| **When does it work?**   | When the listener is attached and the event is triggered.           |
| **What is propagation?** | The process of the event traveling through the DOM tree.            |
