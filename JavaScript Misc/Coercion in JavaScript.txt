Coercion in JavaScript:

**Coercion** is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another by JavaScript, typically in situations involving comparison or arithmetic operations.

There are two types of coercion in JavaScript:

1. **Type Coercion (Implicit)**:
   - JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another during operations, such as comparisons or arithmetic.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log("2" > 1); // true ("2" is coerced to 2, and 2 > 1)
     ```

2. **Explicit Coercion**:
   - You manually convert values from one type to another using functions or methods.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let num = Number("2"); // Explicitly converting the string "2" to a number
     console.log(num); // 2
     ```

### **Coercion in Equality Comparisons (`==`) vs Strict Equality (`===`)**:
- **`==` (loose equality)** allows **type coercion**:
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log("2" == 2); // true (string "2" is coerced to number 2)
    ```
- **`===` (strict equality)** **does not** allow type coercion:
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log("2" === 2); // false (types are different: string vs number)
    ```

### Summary:
- **Type coercion** is JavaScript's automatic conversion of types during operations or comparisons.
- **Explicit coercion** is when you explicitly convert types using functions like `Number()`, `String()`, etc.
